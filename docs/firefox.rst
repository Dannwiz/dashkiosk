Firefox application
===================

A very simple Firefox application can also be used on any OS
supporting Firefox. It is only a thin layer on top of the classic
receiver. The only additional features are:

 - fullscreen
 - orientation locked to landscape

Installation
------------

The installation is quite simple. Point Firefox to the ``/firefox``
endpoint. You should get a page with a button to install the
application.
